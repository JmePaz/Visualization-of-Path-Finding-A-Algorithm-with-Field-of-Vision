# Visualization-of-Path-Finding-A-Algorithm-with-Field-of-Vision [Educational Purposes only]
- Developed a Smart Enemy ( Visualization of Path Finding A* Algorithm  with Field of Vision in 3d Game)
  - Can follow target object position (even a moving target).
- This has two mechanism to follow the target object in a game. Field of view and Path finding Algo.
  A path finding algo is automatically on when the target object is outside the vision of the smart enemy.
  While field of view is switched on when the smart enemy can see the target object, which makes it easier for 
  the smart enemy to just follow the target object. Both mechanism is turned on depending on the situation.
- Unity | 3D
